# CS300-module8
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course delt with different data models (Binary trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists) and their appropriate 
usage within applications. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures allow us to organize and manage data in a way that facilitates efficient access and modification. For example, using arrays for indexed access or linked lists for efficient insertions and deletions.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame any issues by researching the offical documentation of the method, or looking for example uses. Or, sometimes, 
I made a small prototype code element that was simple and then extended that as the logic became more complex.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Through experience, I've become better at evaluating and selecting appropriate tools, technologies, and frameworks for each project. I have also  learned to prioritize understanding the requirements thoroughly before diving into implementation.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think all of these elements come from practice. I have written enough file streams that I now have a common function 
 that I use as a prototype. I might even take a few of some other elements I keep reusing and develop them in to libraries.
